# Advent of Code

Welcome to my [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions!

Advent of Code is an annual event in which participants solve a series of programming puzzles. 
Each day during the event, a new puzzle is released, and participants have the opportunity to solve it and submit their solution.

This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code puzzles. 
Each year is contained in a separate directory.

I try to have a different theme each year. So far my thememes have been

| Year | Theme |
| -----| ------------- |
| 2021 | For each day use a differnet language  |
| 2022 | Use [APL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_(programming_language)) |
| 2023 | Microsoft Excel 365 |
